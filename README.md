# CIFAR-10 Classifier 📷🤖

As a way to sharpen my Python skills and work on Machine Learning I made a Classifier!

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained to recognize 10 different classes of images, such as airplanes, automobiles, cats, and more.

## Features ✨

- **Image Classification**: Classifies images into one of 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck).
- **Web Application**: A Flask web app that allows users to upload images and get predictions based on the trained model.

## Prerequisites ⚙️

Before running the project, you need to have Python 3.6+ installed. You also need to install the required Python libraries.

### Installation 🛠️

1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)

3. **Install dependencies**

   This will install the necessary libraries, including Flask, TensorFlow, and Keras.

## Usage 🚀

1. **Run the Flask web application**:

    Once the dependencies are installed and the model is ready, you can start the web application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Access the application**:

    Open a web browser and navigate to:

    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000
    ```

    You will be able to upload images, and the app will predict the class of the image using the trained model.

## See it in Action!! 🌸
